# 77788J-TP-Mark-I
Mark I of VRC team 77788J's Turning Point code (written with PROS 2 for the Cortex)

This program is written with PROS 2 (https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), an "Open Source C/C++ Development for VEX Cortex."
We have not yet upgraded to the V5 platform, this code is written for the Cortex system. Despite being written with PROS 2
(this project was started before the release of PROS 3), it is programmed in C++.

We are the 'A-team' of Calvary Christian Academy (77788_). This is mark I of our program.
